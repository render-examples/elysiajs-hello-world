# elysiajs-hello-world
This is the [ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com/) [Hello World](https://elysiajs.com/quick-start.html#automatic-installation) example on [Render](https://render.com).

Elysia is a web framework for building backend servers with [Bun](https://bun.sh/). 

## Development

### Prerequisite
If you haven't already, [install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) on your development machine.

### Preview the site
To start the development server, run:
```bash
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy to Render

See the [ElysiaJS quickstart guide](https://docs.render.com/deploy-elysiajs) for full details.

Notes:
* The `render.yaml` file in this repository sets the `BUN_VERSION` environment variable to demonstrate [how to set the Bun version](https://docs.render.com/bun-version) on Render. Feel free to adjust the version as needed.
